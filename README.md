## Introduction
#### What is Neural Network ?
This repository is about Neural Networks. A neural network is a series of algorithms that endeavors to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates. In this sense, neural networks refer to systems of neurons, either organic or artificial in nature.

#### The uses of Neural Network 
+ Character Recognition - The idea of character recognition has become very important as handheld devices like the Palm Pilot are becoming increasingly popular. Neural networks can be used to recognize handwritten characters.
+ Image Compression - Neural networks can receive and process vast amounts of information at once, making them useful in image compression. With the Internet explosion and more sites using more images on their sites, using neural networks for image compression is worth a look.
+ Stock Market Prediction - The day-to-day business of the stock market is extremely complicated. Many factors weigh in whether a given stock will go up or down on any given day. Since neural networks can examine a lot of information quickly and sort it all out, they can be used to predict stock prices.
+ Traveling Saleman's Problem - Interestingly enough, neural networks can solve the traveling salesman problem, but only to a certain degree of approximation.
Medicine, Electronic Nose, Security, and Loan Applications - These are some applications that are in their proof-of-concept stage, with the acception of a neural network that will decide whether or not to grant a loan, something that has already been used more successfully than many humans.
+ Miscellaneous Applications - These are some very interesting (albeit at times a little absurd) applications of neural networks.
